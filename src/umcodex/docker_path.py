"""Finding Docker Desktop's `docker` command when it isn't on PATH.

On a Mac, Docker Desktop keeps its command line tools inside the app
(`Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin`) and links them from /usr/local/bin, or
from ~/.docker/bin when it's set up for one user. When those links are
missing, or the folder isn't on PATH (an app opened from Finder, a shell
without it), `docker` isn't found although Docker Desktop is installed and
running. UM-Codex runs `docker` by name, so at start-up the folder that
holds it is added to the end of PATH, for UM-Codex and everything it starts.
Its credential helpers (`docker-credential-desktop`) are in the same folder,
which `docker pull` needs too. The installer will do the same.
