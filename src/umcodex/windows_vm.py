"""Windows: putting back the right Docker's Linux virtual machine needs to start.

WSL 2 (and so Docker Desktop) runs a Hyper-V virtual machine, which signs in
as `NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\\Virtual Machines` (S-1-5-83-0) and needs the "Log on
as a service" right (SeServiceLogonRight). Hyper-V adds it when Windows
starts. A domain group policy that sets "Log on as a service" to its own list
takes it away again whenever Windows re-applies security policy (on the
Michigan Medicine network, "CoreOne-Security"). From then on no WSL virtual
machine can start: `wsl.exe` fails with Wsl/Service/CreateInstance/CreateVm/
HCS/0x80070569 ("the user has not been granted the requested logon type"),
and Docker Desktop waits for its engine for ever, saying nothing.

Restarting Windows puts the right back, until the policy runs again. So does
GRANT_SCRIPT, behind one administrator prompt: it adds that one right for that
one account and changes nothing else. The installer will run the same text (M2:
installer/windows/install.ps1, `$VmLogonGrant`).

Asking Windows whether the right is there needs an administrator, so UM-Codex
finds out by starting WSL's own small system distribution (`wsl.exe
--system`), never Docker's, and only when Docker isn't answering.

DataLab showed this on its web page with a Fix it button. UM-Codex has no web
page: at launch, `check_before_launch` explains it in the terminal and asks
before showing the administrator prompt (on a Michigan Medicine computer the
person turns on their temporary administrator access first, then answers).
