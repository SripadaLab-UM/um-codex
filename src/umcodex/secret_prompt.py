"""Asking for a key or password in a terminal, showing one * per character.

A hidden prompt (getpass) shows nothing at all, so after a paste nobody can
tell whether it worked. This one shows a * for each character, typed or
pasted, and afterwards says how many characters arrived. It never shows any
part of the value itself.

When the input isn't a terminal (a pipe, tests, CI) it reads a line as
getpass always did: no echo and no *s.
