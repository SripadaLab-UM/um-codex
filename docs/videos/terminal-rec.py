"""Turns macOS `script -r` recordings into a terminal timeline for a video.

    python3 terminal-rec.py <name> <recording> [<recording> ...]

Writes build/<name>/terminal.json: {"events": [[seconds, text], ...]}, the
output of each recording in order (docker's in-place progress bars dropped) (later recordings start where the last
one ended, less a second), with the terminal's control codes reduced to
text, bold (\x01 … \x02) and line breaks. Only output is kept: typed input
isn't recorded here, and nothing typed is ever shown.
