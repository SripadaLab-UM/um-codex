# UM-Codex: design

Status: v0 design, 2026-10-01. Source of most of the machinery:
[IHS DataLab](https://github.com/SripadaLab-UM/ihs-datalab) at `6b6fdca`
(0.3.0b6). Every copied module says so in its first lines.

## What it is

Full-power OpenAI Codex, on U-M GPT Toolkit, running inside a Docker
container on a Mac or Windows computer. There's no web app and no knowledge
base: **Codex's own terminal interface is the front end**. At each launch the
person decides what the container can see and do, then Codex opens in their
terminal.

It follows ITS's "Codex Setup" articles for the model settings (the
`toolkit` provider, `https://api.toolkit.umgpt.umich.edu/v1`,
`gpt-5.6-terra`). It doesn't follow them for the key: there's no
`auth.json` with the key in it (see "The key" below).

**Goal:** a full-power Codex with decent safety, not a locked-down one.
- Internet on means the whole internet.
- Write folders mean write and delete.
- Inside the container, Codex runs commands without asking unless the person
  chooses otherwise, and it can `sudo`.
- The safety comes from **what the container can reach on the host**: only
  the folders that were chosen, and never the key.

## The person's journey

1. **Install:** one command, from the release (or a site later):
   - Mac: `curl -fsSL …/install-macos.sh | sh`
   - Windows: `irm …/install-windows.ps1 | iex`

   The installer:
   1. finds or installs Docker Desktop, and fixes the Windows VM logon right
      (all from DataLab);
   2. installs uv, then UM-Codex with its own Python, in the person's account;
   3. pulls the pinned images;
   4. asks for the Toolkit API key (masked) and saves it in the Keychain or
      Credential Manager;
   5. adds a **UM-Codex** app to Applications and the Desktop (Mac), or to
      Start and the Desktop (Windows), with the logo.
2. **Launch:** the app opens a terminal that runs `um-codex`, or the person
   types `um-codex` in any terminal.
   1. Docker check. If Docker Desktop is closed, it's opened and waited for.
      If Windows refuses its VM (the logon right), it offers DataLab's fix:
      one administrator prompt, then Docker Desktop is restarted.
   2. **Setup.** It lists the saved setups with the last one first ("Use
      *thesis* again? [Y/n]"), or asks for a new one:
      - **Name** (default: the working folder's name).
      - **Working folder** (read, write, delete): Codex starts here. Default:
        the folder `um-codex` was started in, or the Desktop app asks for one.
      - **More folders to write** (read, write, delete). Optional; any number.
      - **Folders to read only.** Optional; any number.
      - **Internet: on or off.** Off means Codex can reach only the model.
      - **Model:** default `gpt-5.6-terra`; the list comes from the Toolkit.
      - **Approvals:** "Codex runs commands without asking" (default), or
        "ask me before commands".
      - A summary screen in plain words, which says that Codex can delete in
        the write folders and, with internet on, could send anything it can
        read anywhere. Then "Start? [Y/n]".
   3. **Codex opens** in the same terminal, inside the container. When the
      person quits Codex, the containers are removed. The setup's Codex
      history is kept, so `codex resume` works next time.
3. **Other commands:**
   - `um-codex setups` lists, edits and deletes setups.
   - `um-codex key` replaces the key.
   - `um-codex doctor` checks Docker, the key, the images and the Toolkit,
     and prints diagnostics with no secrets in them.
   - `um-codex update` installs signed releases (later: see the milestones).
   - `um-codex uninstall`.

## How it runs (one launch)

```
host                                     Docker
────                                     ──────
um-codex (Python)                        network umcodex-<id>-int (internal: no route out)
 ├─ relay on 127.0.0.1:<port> ◄──────────  gateway (nginx, pinned) ◄── agent: codex (TUI)
 │   checks the launch token,               also on a bridge network,        /work         rw  working folder
 │   adds the Toolkit key                   to reach the host's relay        /mnt/write/*  rw  more write folders
 └─ docker exec -it agent codex                                              /mnt/read/*   ro  read-only folders
     (the person's terminal)                                                 /codex-home       setup's volume
                                         internet on: agent also joins       config.toml   ro  from the host
                                         network umcodex-<id>-net (bridge)
```

- **Relay:** a small asyncio HTTP relay in the `um-codex` process. It's
  adapted from DataLab's `relay/` (with its retry and recovery, minus the
  data-session policy). It accepts only this launch's random token, swaps in
  the Toolkit key and streams the reply. It's only ever bound to localhost,
  and it ends when the launch ends.
- **Gateway:** DataLab's nginx container and config, minus `/mcp`. Codex's
  `base_url` is `http://gateway/v1`.
- **Agent:** this repo's image, `ghcr.io/sripadalab-um/um-codex-agent`, pinned
  by digest. It's a non-root `agent` user with passwordless sudo inside the
  container, has no Docker socket, isn't privileged, and adds no host
  capabilities.
  - **Internet off:** it's on the internal network only, with DataLab's
    no-DNS setting.
  - **Internet on:** it's on a normal bridge network too, with full internet.
    Model calls still go through the gateway.
- **Codex home is a named Docker volume per setup** (`umcodex-home-<setup>`),
  not a host folder. DataLab learned that Codex makes Linux symlinks there,
  and the Windows uninstaller then tripped on them (#36). A volume also keeps
  Codex's history off the host's synced folders.
- **config.toml** is written by the host and mounted read-only over the
  volume. From DataLab's `codex_config.py`, it sets:
  - `model_provider = "toolkit"`, pointing at the gateway, with `env_key` for
    the launch token;
  - `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`, because the container is the
    sandbox;
  - `approval_policy`: `never` (the default) or `on-request`, from the setup;
  - `web_search = "live"` when the internet is on, otherwise `disabled`;
  - analytics, feedback and update checks off.

  Codex's other features stay at Codex's defaults: full power.
- **AGENTS.md** in the image tells Codex where things are: the folders, what's
  read-only, and whether the internet is on.
- **The terminal:**
  - The container starts with `sleep infinity`, then
    `docker exec -it <agent> codex` runs in the foreground with the person's
    terminal size. On Windows, the same works in Windows Terminal and
    PowerShell.
  - Ctrl-C belongs to Codex.
  - When `docker exec` ends, `um-codex` removes the containers and network.
    If `um-codex` itself is killed, the next launch removes leftovers by label.
- **Two launches at once** each get their own containers, network and token.
  Two launches of the *same* setup share its Codex home volume, which Codex
  handles: sessions are separate files.

## The key

ITS's articles put the key in `~/.codex/auth.json`. In a container with
internet on, that would let anything Codex runs (or a web page's prompt
injection) read it and send it out. Here the key is:
- in the Keychain or Credential Manager (DataLab's `credentials.py`);
- read only by the relay on the host;
- never in a container, an environment variable, a file, a log or diagnostics.

The container has only a per-launch token, which works only through that
launch's gateway, and only while the launch lasts.

## Folder rules

These come from DataLab's mount checks (`sessions/mounts.py` and
`inputs.private_place`), loosened to fit this purpose:
- Paths must be absolute and must exist. They're resolved, so a symlink
  can't widen what's shared.
- Refused for every access:
  - the home folder itself, `/`, or a whole drive (`C:\`);
  - UM-Codex's own data folder;
  - the key store, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.codex`;
  - Docker's own folders.

  The person gets a plain reason. Subfolders of home are fine.
- The same folder can't be both read-only and writable. A read-only folder
  inside a writable one stays readable through the writable mount; the
  summary screen says so.
- Windows: paths are converted for Docker the way DataLab does. Folders on a
  network drive get a warning, not a refusal.

## What's new compared with DataLab

- **The launch questions and saved setups:** prompt and validation code, all
  new.
- **Writable mounts.** DataLab never mounts host folders writable. This is
  the deliberate difference, and the summary screen makes it visible.
- **The internet-on network:** DataLab's research proxy is replaced by a
  plain bridge network. Squid isn't needed, because there's no allowlist.
- **An interactive `docker exec -it`,** in place of DataLab's app-server
  JSON-RPC. It's simpler: no runtime, events or store.

Left out (DataLab only): the web app, SQLite, sessions/conversations,
Oracle, the knowledge base and pipelines, GitHub, safety checks, exports,
modes, rigor, and the frontend.

## Milestones

1. **M1, runs from source on a Mac:**
   - `uv run um-codex`: setup prompts, relay, gateway, agent image built
     locally, Codex opens, internet on and off both work, cleanup.
   - Tests for folder rules, config, the relay token and cleanup.
2. **M2, installers and CI:**
   - the Mac and Windows installers (Docker step, uv, key, launcher, icon);
   - uninstallers;
   - CI with Windows tests and the installer parse and run steps;
   - the agent image built and pushed to GHCR.
3. **M3, releases:** signed releases (Ed25519, the `release` environment,
   the tag rules) and `um-codex update` with rollback.
4. **Acceptance, on a fresh Mac and a fresh Windows machine:**
   1. install from the README in under 20 minutes;
   2. launch with internet off: Codex answers, `curl https://example.com`
      fails, and it can write in the working folder but not in a read-only
      one;
   3. launch with internet on: `curl` works, and `pip install` works;
   4. the key isn't anywhere in the container (`grep -r` over `/`, `env`);
   5. quit, relaunch, and `codex resume` finds the last session;
   6. uninstall leaves nothing but the person's own folders.

## Open questions (with defaults)

- Linux hosts: not in v0. The articles cover Linux, and adding it later is
  mostly the installer.
- An install site like DataLab's: later. Until then, the README has the two
  install commands.
- Codex version: pinned in the image, and updated by a release.
